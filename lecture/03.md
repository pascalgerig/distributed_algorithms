# Timing assumption
## Asychronous system
Logical clock creates a logical time:
* Each proces P keeps a logical clock lp (initially 0)
* When an event on p occurs, then lp <- lp + 1 (Event = generalisation of computation step)
* when p sends a msg. m to q, then p attaches a timestamp ts(m) = lp to m
* When p receives a msg with ts(m') then p sets lp <- max{lp, ts(m')} + 1

### Happens-before relation
 e1 -> e2 means e1 happens before e2

 process p: 
  p --- e1 ------ e2 ->     e1 happens before e2

  p -------- e1 ------>
              \                           e1 happens before e2
  q ---------- e2 ---->

  p -------- e1 ------>
              \                           e1 happens before e2
  q ---------- e' ---->
                \                         e1 happens before e2 if e1 before e' and e' before e2
  r ------------ e2 ---->

  p ---------e-------->
  q -------f---------->                   not sure which event happened first

  Lemma:
  e1 occurs at p at lp
  e2 occurs at q at lq:
  if e1 -> e2, then lp < lq

  ## Synchronous system
  Either:   Assume every process has access to a real-time clock (RTC)

  Or:       * Synchronous computation (bound on computation time) (You know how long computation takes)
            * Synchronous communication (bound on message-transmission time) 
  
  Careful When synchrony assumptions are needed for safety properties!

  ## Partially synchronous model
  * Synchronous most of the time
  * When asynchronous, must not violate safety

  Formally captured by abstraction of an eventually synchronous system
  * Initial period of asynchrony
  * After some point in time (unknown to algorithm), system is synchronous

  Note: Abstract model will remain synchronous forever after sync point. In practice, periods of synchrony and asynchrony alternate

  # Abstracting time
  ## Def: Perfect Failure Detector (P) 
    (in synchronous model, because we assume we know sending and receiving time)
    Event:      
    * <P, Crash | p> denotes that we detect, that process p has crashed
    
    Properties: 
    * Strong Completeness: Eventually every process that has crashed, is deteted by every correct process
    * Strong accuracy: For any process p, if p detects that q crashed, then q has crashed
        Formally: all processes are either aliver forever or they crash and stop

        Suppose a notion of time N
            C: N -> Pi, C(t) denotes the processes that are live at time t
            F: N -> Pi, F(t) denotes the processes that are faulty (crashed) at time t
            p element F(t), then for all t' >= t: p element F(t') (crashes are irreversible)

            F(caligraph) = Union for t>=0 of F(t)
            C(caligraph) = Pi \ F(caligraph)
    * Strong completeness formally:
        There is a `t` such that for all p element F(caligraph), for all q element C(Caligraph) there is t'>=t: <P, Crash | p> occures on process q at time t'
    * Strong accuracy:
        For all q element C(caligraph), if <P, Crash | p> occurs on process q at time, then p in F(t)
  
  ## Implementation of P
    Init:
        start timer Delta (> 2x transmition time + processingtime)
        alive <- Pi
        detected <- Empty
    
    upon timeout do
        for all p element Pi do
            if p not element alive and p not element detected then
                trigger <P, Crash | p>
                detected <- detected U {p}
        alive <- Empty
        send msg [PING] to all p element Pi
        start timer with Delta

    upon receiving msg [PING] from p do
        send msg [PONG] to p

    upon receiving [PONG] from p do
        alive <- alive U {p}

  ## Leader Election
  Event: <le.Leader | p>, elects p to be the leader
  Properties:
    * Eventual Leadership: Eventually some process l is elected to be the leader every correct process
    * Accuracy: If a process is elected leader, then all previously elected leaders have crashed

  ## Eventually perfect failure Detectore
  (in partially synchronous model)

  Events: 
    * <DiamondP.suspect | p> process p is suspected to have failed
    * <DiamondP.restore | p> process p is thought to be alive

  Properties:
    * Strong completeness: Eventually, every process that has crashed is suspected by every correct process
    * Eventuall strong Accuracy: Eventually, every process that has crashed is suspeced permanently by every correct process
