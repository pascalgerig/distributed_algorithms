# Models and Abstractions

Communication abstr.

Set of processes Pi
|Pi| = N

* A process is an automaton
* A protocol is a set of processes (it usually has an automaton to connect the processes such as in diagram above)

## Execution
* Each computation step and every step of sending or receiving a message is an event.
* An execution / history / trace is a sequence of all events of the processes as seen by a (hypothetical) global observer

## Properties
* for specifying abstractions
* Are specified on executions

### Safety properties
* something "bad" has not happened (past tense since only observable on past executions)
* If a property P has been violated in some execution E, then there exists a prefix E' of E such that in every extension
of E', the property P is violated.
* A Prefix is a part of execution from the beginning to some point

E.g. for Buying Protocol: You get item if you pay. If shop gets money without you getting item, this safety property is violated.

### Liveness property
* something "good" will happen in the future (eventually)
* Property P can be satisfied by some extension E' of a given execution E

Safety or Liveness alone are useless, only combination of both properties is usefull!

## Process failures
(A process consists of different modules, eighter all modules fail at once or none)
* Crashes
* Omission failures
  * Process omits certain steps, but continues afterwards - e.g. message sending / receiving events are omitted
* Crash-recovery failure
  * store operation to write to stable storage
  * upon recovery, one can restore data from stable storage
* Eavesdropping fault: attacker is reading data, that he should not be able to access
* Arbitrary fault (Byzantine fault): Process behaves as directed by attacker, not as specified by Protocol

## Cryptographic abstraction
### Tools for integrity (proper sender):
* Hash functions (SHA-256)
  H: {0, 1}^* -> {0, 1}^k
  * collision-free: diffucult to find x, x' with x != x' and H(x) = H(x')

* Digital signatures (RSA, (EC)DSA)
  * sign(p, m) -> s (p process, m message) only p can call this method because private key
  * verifying (p, m, s) -> YES / NO, every process can call this method because public key
  Correctness:
    for all m,p: verifying(p,m, sign(p, m)) = YES
  Security:
    for all m, p, s: verifying(p, m, s) = NO
    unless process p has executed sign(p, m) -> s

* Message-authentication code MAC (HMAC-SHA256)
  * authenticate(p, q, m) -> a (only callable by process p)
  * verifyanth(p, q, m, q) -> YES/NO (only callable by processes p or q)
  * through symmetrical encryption

## Communication
Every process can send messages to every other process, in theory full connectivity, every process has direct connection to every other process

### Stubborn point-to-point links
Events: <sl.send|q, m> -> send message to process q
        <sl.deliver|p, m> -> deliver a received message m from process p

Properties:
    Stubborn delivery: If a process sends a message m to process q, then m is infinitely often delivered at q. (liveness property)
    No creation: If some process q delivers some m from p, then process p has previously sent m to q. (safety property)

### Perfect point-to-point links
Events: <pl.send|q,m> -> send message to process q
        <pl.deliver|p,m> -> deliver a received message m from process p

Properties:
    Reliable delivery: If a correct process sends a message to a correct process q, then q eventually delivers m.
    No creation: If process q delivers some m from process q, the p has sent m to q.
    At-most-once-delivery: Every message m is at most delivered once from p to q

Algorithm implementing perfect links (pl) from stubborn links (sl):
  Init: do
    D <- Empty

  upon <pl.send|q, m> do
    trigger <sl.send|q,m>

  upon <sl.deliver|p,m> do
    if (p, m) not in D then
      D <- D U {(p,m)}
      trigger <pl.deliver|p,m>

## Timing assumptions
* Asynchronous model
  logical time:

  process p: --- e1 ------ e2 ------>     e1 happens before e2

  p -------- e1 ------->
              \                           e1 happens before e2
  q ---------- e2 ----->

  p ---------e-------->
  q -------f---------->                   not sure which event happened first
