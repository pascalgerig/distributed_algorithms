Idea: If a process detects a failed process with NPFD, we broadcast this information to all other alive processes.

Implementation:

Init:
    start timer Delta
    alive <- PI
    detected <- Empty

upon timeout do
    for all p element alive
        if p failed in last NPFD run
            trigger <NPFD, detectedFailure | p>

    restart timer
    run NPFD

upon <NPFD, detectedFailure | failedProcess> do
    alive <- alive \ failedProcess
    detected <- detected U failedProcess

# 3.2
a)  Init:
        alive <- Pi
        detected <- Empty
        for all p element alive do
            start timer Delta + Phi + 1
        start timer Delta + Phi for self

    upon timeout for p not self do
        trigger <P, Crash | p>
        detected <- detected U {p}
        alive <- alive \ p

    upon receiving heartbeat from p do
        wait until timer for p = 1
        reset timer for p

    upon timeout for self do
        reset timer for self
        trigger <P, heartbeat | self>

b)  Every process triggers a heartbeat every Delta + Phi, that heartbeat takes max. delta + phi to arrive at every other alive process. Therefor if after delta + phi + 1, no heartbeat arrives, the not received heartbeat is interpreted as the other process havin crashed. At the same moment every process triggers a new heartbeat and it starts over again.

On the other hand Algorithm 2.5 does not work with heartbeats but with request/response instead
