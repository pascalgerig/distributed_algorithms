Events:
A cook asking Alice to hand him max. `count` jobs: <Cook, getJob | count>
Alice telling a cook which jobs to do: <Alice, deliverJob | jobs, Cook>
A customer ordering a dish: <Customer, orderDish | menu>
A cook handing a dish back to Alice: <Cook, returnDish | menu>
Alice serving the `menu` to the `customer`: <Alice, serveDish | menu, Customer>
Loops the cook to prepare all dishes: <Cook, prepareDish | >

Properties:
* every customer will eventually get his/her order
* no dish is delivered if it was not ordered
* every customer gets each order exactly once

# 2.2
Definition Safety Property:
* If a property P has been violated in some execution E, then there exists a prefix E' of E such that in every extension
of E', the property P is violated.

Definition Liveness Property:
* Property P can be satisfied by some extension E' of a given execution E


a) safety property -> if we asume the property was violated as described in ex. b), then every extension of an execution up to the point where m2 is delivered after t, will result in A attacking after B and not at the same time

b) safety property -> descirbes a violation of the property described in a), see argumentation in a)

c) liveness property -> given any partially completed execution E were both messages were delivered, we can always extend E to E', such that this property will hold.

safety property -> fiven an prefix of an execution, where m1 is not delivered, then both Generals (and in paritcular B) will not attack in any extension of the prefix

-> mixture of liveness and safety!


d) liveness property -> given an Execution E were m1 and m2 were not intercepted and arrived at the receiver, then we can extend E to E' such that both Generals will have launched their Attack.

e) mixture -> combination of a), because both should attack at same time and d), because both should eventually attack.
